I had promised myself I would update the blog once I moved to Cambridge, but I'm still settling in. The journey from Italy to the UK was smooth—flights and trains were on time (surprisingly, given it's summer)—and I easily reached the room I had rented. Let’s not get into too much detail about that last part because it’s been quite uncomfortable, and I’m still debating whether to leave or stick it out for the two months I’ll be staying in the UK.
In fact—just a quick side note—my MSCA project will take place between Cambridge and Campeche, Mexico, and hopefully by the end of summer I’ll already be on my way to collect data on crocodile cognitive behaviour… but I’ll explain that another time!

The day after I arrived, I woke up early and walked 45 minutes to Anglia Ruskin University to meet my supervisor, Dr Claudia Wascher, who gave me a full tour of the university—rooms, staircases, corridors, and people she introduced me to and whom I’ll be working with in the future.
I’m extremely grateful for the time she dedicated to me upon arrival and for her ongoing support (especially in helping me sort out all the university bureaucracy!).

After that, I camped out in the café: since I don’t have my staff card yet, I can’t access my office… I know, it’s a bit funny, but that’s the situation! Luckily, the university is quite empty at the moment—it’s July—so the café tends to be quiet, there are power outlets, and with a packed lunch I can work there until late before heading home.

These days I’m focusing on completing university paperwork, a systematic review on the topics I’ll be addressing in my project, and plenty of other things.
If co-living in this temporary home is a bit exasperating, on the other hand, I find myself in a new academic environment that seems full of potential—and most of all, it’s giving me back the urge to do science!

Stay tuned for updates from the field (literally!) and some reflections on what it means to research animal behaviour.

See you soon!
