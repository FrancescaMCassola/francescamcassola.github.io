Life in Cambridge goes on. Regarding my project, it seems I have completed the data extraction from my systematic review (I won’t say too much about it, to avoid giving away an idea to others) and now, together with my supervisor, we need to think about how to best manage the information. In the meantime, we are in the middle of preparations for ECBB 2026, the European Conference on Behavioural Biology, which will be held right here at Anglia Ruskin University (you can follow updates on various social media, including → https://x.com/ECBB2026).

Being part of the central organising committee, I have some important tasks to carry out. The things we do for science and outreach!
I’m starting to personalise my desk, collecting mugs for various uses (that is, one for water, one for coffee, and one for tea), and little by little I’m getting to know my colleagues. Many people are still on holiday, and since we’re not in term time, there’s not much coming and going between departments.
We are still in the planning phase for the trip that will take me to collect data on crocodiles, but I can already tell you that the 2025 generation is being born – they sent me a video, and I was deeply moved. The aforementioned systematic review will also help me understand how to best structure my cognitive tests on our animals. In the meantime, I’m waiting for the documents I’ll need to apply for my Mexican visa.
I can’t wait to tell you more!
As for the rest, I’ve had the chance to explore Cambridge and visited the Botanical Garden – which has an entrance fee – and it’s truly, truly beautiful.

Well managed, with many tourists but also many locals who use the place as a meeting spot or for picnics. One section I particularly enjoyed is dedicated to systematics, constantly updated to reflect the most recent taxonomic changes in plants.

And I’ve also found a friend…

After visiting the Botanical Garden, on the same day, I went into the city centre under the pretext of buying a pair of house slippers and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the university museums are free… As fate would have it, I was near the Zoology Museum. Did I go in? Of course!

I must say, it is very well organised in its sections. The evolutionary section, describing the origin and development of the various animal groups, is very well done, as is the section dedicated to large vertebrates. Although the building’s space is not excessively large, the collections have been arranged in such a way that it feels more spacious.

Have I already bought some gadgets? Yes. Will I visit it again? Absolutely, many times.
Among other things, I also managed to squeeze in a quick trip to London. Friends and I booked a ticket to see The Phantom of the Opera,

but we also took the opportunity to go for a long walk (and, for my part, buy some tea).

See you next time!
